# Anti-AFK-Kick-Minecraft
This is a program made in python that gets you not AFK-kicked from servers.
This is perfect if you have AFK farms on a server with auto AFK kick enabled.
Made in Python 3.9

What it does is it opens and closes a door once every 5 minutes. Therefore you need a door to use this.

You can use auto-py-to-exe (https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/), but if you send it to a friend or other people, it is going to mark it as a virus or a treath. This is a known python problem and i as of now have no fix.
